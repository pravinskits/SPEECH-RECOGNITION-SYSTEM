Description:

The provided Python script is designed to transcribe speech from an audio file using the Google Web Speech API. It uses the speech_recognition library to perform the transcription task. The function transcribe_speech(file_path) takes the path to an audio file (in WAV format) as input. It creates a Recognizer object, loads the audio using AudioFile, and listens to the content with a specified timeout and phrase time limit. Once the audio is captured, it attempts to transcribe the spoken words into text using Google's speech recognition service. If successful, it returns the transcribed text. If the speech is unintelligible or if there is a connectivity issue with the API, appropriate error messages are returned. The script includes a test block under if __name__ == "__main__" that demonstrates how to use the function with a sample audio file named sample.wav.
